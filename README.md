CircusGameDev2014Q3TeamSamus
============================

The repository for the game made by Team Samus in Chris Silich's game dev class at the Creative Circus in Q3 2014


I've already set up a few folders as a guideline, but feel free to change it up:
* design- where designers will store work in progress PSDs and the like
* writing- where writers will store documents
* planning- where you can store shared documents like brainstorms, division of labor plans, etc
* reference- for links, screenshots, etc
* *game-* for the unity project itself


####About the game folder:####
One person on each team should create this folder by making the new unity project called "game". Make sure it's called game, because I already set up the repository to ignore temporary Unity build files in this folder.
